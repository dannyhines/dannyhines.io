How do I change the upstream repository's url? How do I see the diff between staged changes
and commits? Here are the 27 most common git commands along with explanations of each, ready
for you to copy and paste into the terminal.

<h1 id='git-init' className='not-prose' style={{ marginBottom: '0 !important' }}>
  git init
</h1>

Initializes the current directory as a git repo

```bash
git init
```

# git clone

Copy the repository i.e. `username/project` into a new folder called `project`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project
```

Copy `username/project` into a new folder called `my-project`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git my-project
cd my-project
```

# git status

Shows the status of the working tree

```bash
git status
```

For a less verbose alternative, add `-s` for short or `-sb` if you want to include the
branch too:

```bash
git status -sb
```

# git pull

```bash
# Fetches the changes from the remote and merge it into local repo
git pull origin master
```

# git add

Adds the file(s) to the index, which will be committed when you run `git commit`. Also
called "staging".

```bash
git add script.js
```

That will stage the `script.js` file. To add all files:

```bash
git add .
```

This will ignores the files listed in `.gitignore`

# git commit

Commits the changes to the local repository:

```bash
git commit -m "my commit message"
```

Instead of adding a new commit, this will add the changes to the most recent commit:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

# git log

Shows the latest commit logs

```bash
git log
```

# git diff

Shows the changes between unstaged files (what's currently in your local project) and what's
been committed:

```bash
git diff
```

Shows the changes between staged (after running `git add`) files and what's been committed:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

# git remote

A "remote" is a version of your code that's stored on the internet. By default if you create
a Github repository it will be called "origin". Typically when you fork a repository, the
main repo is called the "upstream" repo and has read-only access, and you commit changes to
your local version "origin", which can be merged into the upstream repo with a pull request.

To list the remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

### Add a remote

git remote add [remote name] [remote url]

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mainOrganization/project.git
```

### Change a remote's url

git remote add [remote name] [new url]

```bash
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/main-organization/project.git
```

# git checkout

Change to a branch. This will change your local filesystem to have what's on that branch.

```bash
git checkout my-branch
```

Create a new branch and check it out:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

To do this you can't have unsaved changes that will conflict with the branch you're changing
to. To revert the unsaved changes on your current branch:

```bash
git checkout .
```

To remove the unstaged changes for a particular file:

```bash
git checkout -- script.js
```

# git push

Pushes the local changes (commits) to the remote repository. This will push the main branch
to the remote called `origin`:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If the remote repository has commits that your local repo doesn't have, you'll need to pull
the changes from the remote first.

If you're a bad boy, you can force push with `-f` which will replace the remote's files with
whatever you've committed.

```bash
git push -f origin master
```

### Push and set the remote as upstream

This is the same as `git push --set-upstream origin my-branch`

```bash
git push -u origin my-branch
```

# git branch

`git branch` will list your branches.

To delete a local branch:

```bash
git branch -d my-branch
```

If the branch you're trying to delete hasn't been merged, you'll need to toss an additional
`--force` flag.

If you have a lot of local branches, use [this snippet](/snippets/delete-local-branches) to
delete the local branches that have already been merged to the main branch.

# git clean

Removes all the files and directories that are not yet tracked by git:

```bash
git clean -fd
```

# git merge

Merges `other-branch` into the current branch:

```bash
git merge other-branch
```

# git reset

This will remove all the changes to the tracked files that have not yet been committed:

```bash
git reset --hard
```
