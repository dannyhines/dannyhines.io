## Background

As a Node.js developer I enjoy messing around with different side projects, and I’ll
periodically clone a repository online, install the dependencies with
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and after a day or two I’ll move on to the next thing.

In order to run a Node app you need the packages, which are downloaded and placed in the
project's **node_modules** folder when you run `npm install` (or `yarn` if you’re a bad
boy). You need these packages in order to run the project, but they usually take up more
space than the project code itself.

Then if you’re like me, you’re left with dozens of random projects in a folder called
`open-source` in a folder called `Misc`, all of which containing MBs of code that is
potentially deprecated.

These folders can waste valuable space on your hard drive, and it can be tedious to manually
search through your project directories to find and delete them.

To help solve this problem, I created this script you can run on macOS to remove the
**node_modules** folder for any project that hasn't been accessed in a given number of days
(here I’m setting it to 30):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the threshold for inactivity in days
inactive_threshold=30

# Set the path to the folder you want to scan
proj_folder=~/Documents/Misc

# Find all project directories in the Documents folder that have a node_modules folder
# and haven't been accessed in over the inactive threshold
for project in $(find "$proj_folder" -type d -name node_modules -mtime +"$inactive_threshold" -print); do
  # Remove the node_modules folder for the project
  rm -rf "$project"
done
```

This script will go through every project in the `~/Documents/Misc` folder (this is where I
clone projects I don’t care about). For every project has not been accessed within the
**inactive_threshold**, it will remove the **node_modules** folder.

### Running it on a schedule

You can run that script once in the folder(s) you want to clean. To run it daily, you can
use the **cron** utility.

  We'll use `0 0 * * *` for the cron job to run every night at midnight. To run it only on
  Sundays you could do `0 0 * * 0`; use [this](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) if you need help
  building the cron command.
</GrayBox>

Open a terminal and type `crontab -e`. This will open the crontab file in your default text
editor. Then add this line to the file (replacing **`/path/to/script.sh`** with the actual
path to the script):

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

Save and close the file.

> If you're unfamiliar with Vim: to edit you need to enter editing mode by pressing `i`. To
> save, type `:` to enter the prompt bar at the bottom, then type `x` and press Enter.

The script will now run daily at midnight and delete the **`node_modules`** folder for any
project that hasn't been accessed in the past 30 days, freeing up storage on your hard
drive.

**Note**: Make sure that you understand the implications of this before setting this up.
This will essentially break Node projects after 30 days until you run `npm install`/`yarn`.
You may want to alter the parameters for your use case.
