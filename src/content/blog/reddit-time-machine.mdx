## Reddit

As _the front page of the internet_, Reddit is the ultimate collection of internet folklore.
I'm a big fan of memes,
[copypastas](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9uxpve/hi_can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_subreddit_is_about/)
and stories like
[Bean Dad](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10247075/what-is-bean-dad-story-twitter-meaning).
Recently I saw an old meme and started thinking about how internet humor has changed over
the past decade or so, from simple block text to pop culture references to
poorly-photoshopped meta memes.

There are hundreds of thousands of posts per day, with hundreds of millions of active users.
Because it's been a top website for over a decade, I realized I could make a sort of time
capsule to show what the internet found the most funny/interesting/infuriating at a
particular point in time.

### The Reddit API

Instead of using Reddit's own API, I found an even better search functionality in
[pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/). The Pushshift API was created by a
legend named Jason Baumgartner, who basically scraped the entire Reddit dataset and built an
API on top of it. As far as I can tell it's funded by donations (I donated) and
[r/pushshift](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/) is an active community for using the API.

## Retrieving posts

The Pushshift API is better than the Reddit API in that you can search the most upvoted
posts by subreddit in a specific date range.
[The website's documentation](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/) has the list of possible
parameters, and you can also find help in the r/pushshift subreddit. Here's how I create the
url for searching the different subreddits:

```ts
// startDate is the date in unix time
const endDate = (startDate || new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 86400; // 1 day later
const baseURl =
  'https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/?sort_type=score&sort=desc&size=25';
const url = baseURl + `&after=${startDate}&before=${endDate}&subreddit=`;
```

That will return 25 posts with the most points (in decreasing order) between the two dates.
So to search for memes, for example, I just use that url and add a comma-separated list of
subreddits to search in:

```ts
const [memes, setMemes] = useState<Post[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const fetchData = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  fetch(url + 'memes,memeeconomy,dankmemes,adviceanimals')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((res) => {
      setMemes(res.data.slice(0, 10));
    })
    .catch(() => {
      setMemes([]);
    })
    .finally(() => {
      // set loading to false
    });
};
```

Basically whenever the date is changed by the user, we call that API for the news, memes,
etc and set them in our state to display as posts.

## The UI

Instead of building out components from scratch, I decided to go with
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for the design system. AntD is an open-source React design
system that gives you tons of reusable components out of the box. Because I knew it would be
a simple website, one of the most important factors for choosing Ant Design is that it has a
nice [DatePicker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker/). It makes it easy to create
and handle interactions:

<iframe
  src='https://codesandbox.io/embed/basic-antd-4-22-2-liom67?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark'
  height='440'
  width='100%'
  style={{ border: 0, borderRadius: '8px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
/>
<br />
For displaying the posts, I utilize the AntD [Card
component](https://ant.design/components/card/). I found that it looks best to have images
on their own cards, and the News/Predictions/Politics look better as a list on a Card:

<MdxRow>
  <MdxCol>
    <CloudinaryImg
      mdx
      publicId='/dannyhines.io/reddit-time-machine/news-list_ylw7si.png'
      alt='News list'
      width={422}
      height={376}
    />
  </MdxCol>
  <MdxCol>
    <CloudinaryImg
      mdx
      publicId='/dannyhines.io/reddit-time-machine/img-card_mxsdx2.png'
      alt='image card'
      width={422}
      height={403}
    />
  </MdxCol>
</MdxRow>

### Dealing with images

Because of the age and scope of Reddit posts, dealing with images is a bit of a nuisance.
Every post can have a `thumbnail` and a `preview` object, which has a nested object `images`
that has an array of `resolutions` in increasing size. Posts that are just photos also
include the image in the main url with a separate field indicating the image source (Reddit,
imgur, etc).

To add to the fun, sometimes the `post.thumbnail` is "default", so if you check if the
thumbnail exists, you'll be looking for an image named "default" which throws an error.
That's what led to gross functions like this for trying to get a valid image url:

```tsx
const getThumbnail = (post: Post) => {
  const imgResolutions = post.preview?.images.resolutions ?? [];
  const thumbnailUrl =
    post.thumbnail && post.thumbnail !== 'default' ? post.thumbnail : undefined;
  const previewUrl =
    imgResolutions && imgResolutions.length ? imgResolutions[0].url : undefined;
  return thumbnailUrl ?? previewUrl ?? 'default_thumbnail.png';
};
```

The ListView component shows the thumbnail, post title, and other details for each post,
using AntD components to maintain styling:

```tsx
const ListView: React.FC<ListViewProps> = (props) => {
  const { title, posts } = props;

  return (
    <>
      <h3>{title}</h3>

      <Card style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
        <List
          dataSource={posts}
          locale={{ emptyText: `No ${title} to show` }}
          renderItem={(item) => (
            <List.Item>
              <List.Item.Meta
                avatar={
                  <Avatar
                    shape='square'
                    src={getThumbnail(item)}
                    size='large'
                    alt={item.title}
                  />
                }
                title={
                  <a href={item.url} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
                    {text}
                  </a>
                }
                description={
                  <a href={item.full_link} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
                    {text}
                  </a>
                }
              />
            </List.Item>
          )}
        />
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};
```

Notice the title is a link that directs to the `post.url` i.e. the news article, and
clicking the text below (the author, subreddit and number of points) directs to the
`full_link` which is the post on Reddit.

### The layout

I use Ant Design's [Grid](https://ant.design/components/grid/) to layout the content using
Rows and Cols, which can easily change width with the size of the screen using the
breakpoints (i.e. 'sm' is when **screen ≥ 576px**, 'md' is **screen ≥ 768px**, etc).

I struggled for a while to decide on how to order the content. I decided to keep the images
at the top because pictures catch your eye, and I decided that news should be first to
capture major events, followed by politics.

## Adding Predictions

After sending the link in my college GroupMe, my friend Hugh made a suggestion: along with
news, I could display "predictions" from subreddits like r/futurology. It would be
interesting to see what people thought would be possible in the future, and how clearly
wrong some predictions can be. After messing around with the API, I realized that searching
"by [date]" gives the best results, and "predicts", "goal", or "prediction" result in a lot
of false positives.

Here's an interesting example from two random days in 2012 and 2016:

<MdxRow>
  <MdxCol>
    <CloudinaryImg
      mdx
      publicId='/dannyhines.io/reddit-time-machine/predictions1_jqcuxx.png'
      alt='predictions from 2012'
      width={433}
      height={405}
    />
  </MdxCol>
  <MdxCol>
    <CloudinaryImg
      mdx
      publicId='/dannyhines.io/reddit-time-machine/predictions2_njuhdg.png'
      alt='predictions from 2016'
      width={436}
      height={523}
    />
  </MdxCol>
</MdxRow>

r/Futorology is an optimistic bunch, huh?
