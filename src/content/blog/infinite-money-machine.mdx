The internet is filled with potential 100x investments, supposed "passive income" and “get
rich quick” schemes, most of which I don’t listen to for more than a few seconds. But this
guy did it for real. With a bunch of gift cards, a few minutes a day and the legal precedent
that credit-card rewards aren’t income, he created an infinite money machine.

### The Blueprint for the Money Machine

In 2012, after earning his PhD from MIT and doing whatever theoretic physicists do, Anikeev
turned his attention to credit cards. While browsing personal finance websites, he found
that his AmEx card offered unlimited 5% rewards at grocery stores and pharmacies after he
spent $6,500, with not limits.

He also noted that grocery stores sell pre-paid gift cards, which only charge a 1% fee.

Then he created his plan: him and his wife would buy as many Visa gift cards as possible
using their 5% rewards AmEx Blue cards. Because they couldn’t transfer the gift card into a
checking account, they used the cards to buy money orders, which could be used to pay off
the credit card balance.

The 5% rewards on purchases would more than cover the 0.8-1.2% fee on the gift cards and
0.07-0.33% fee on money orders.

All of the purchases on Visa gift cards earned Reward Dollars, which Anikeev could redeem as
statement credits. The beauty of this plan is is that according to the IRS, rebates and
reward points are treated as a discount and not income. Meaning the money was truly free.

### The Perpetual Money Machine

Between 2013 and 2014, while working for IBM as a consultant, Anikeev put his plan into
action. He would stop by grocery stores on his commute to purchase the maximum allowable
amount of prepaid gift cards per day. He then bought money orders using those gift cards and
deposited them into his bank account. This cycle allowed him to pocket the difference
between the rewards and fees, effectively turning his credit card into a perpetual money
machine.

In a $500 transaction, the 5% rewards would yield $25, which was more than enough to cover
the gift-card fees of about $5 and the $1 fee on the money order. It was a beautiful,
self-sustaining money-making machine.

In 2013, Over the course of 2013 and 2014, Konstantin and his wife managed to rack up a
staggering **$6.4 million** in credit-card charges, netting them $36,200 in 2013 and
$277,275 in 2014.

That's about $313,000 total or $402,000 in todays dollars... tax free.

Of course, the fun couldn't last forever. While American Express didn’t mind it, Anikeev’s
tomfoolery soon caught the attention of Uncle Sam. The IRS issued a “notice of deficiency”
to him and his wife, claiming the money made through the scheme was income and should be
taxed accordingly. Anikeev, however, argued that it was simply rebates on purchases.

### The Verdict

At trial, the IRS argued that the Anikeevs purchased cash equivalents like Visa gift cards
and reloadable debit cards instead of goods or services, making the rewards they received
taxable income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Anikeevs countered that
the rewards were not taxable and that the manner of purchase and ultimate use of the Visa
gift cards should not matter.

It wasn’t until 2021 that the U.S. Tax Count finally came to a ruling in
[Anikeev v. Commisioner](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15074956498010914396&q=anikeev&hl=en&as_sdt=20006).
In a surprising turn of events, the judge sided with Anikeev. **The ruling stated that the
AmEx perpetual money machine was non-taxable because the Visa gift cards were a product, not
a cash equivalent**.

The judge explained that a taxpayer who takes advantage of discounts in acquiring goods and
services has no accession to wealth but simply has reduced consumption. The income tax law
imposes a tax only on the future penny earned, not on the current penny saved.

Konstantin you son of a bitch, you did it.

### The Legacy of Anikeev's Infinite Money Machine

Konstantin Anikeev's story is a fascinating case study in creativity, determination, and
clever financial planning. His infinite money machine not only allowed him to earn a
substantial sum of money but also to keep it all tax-free. While it's unlikely that we'll
see a repeat of this particular strategy anytime soon, it serves as a testament to the
potential rewards of thinking outside the box.

Anikeev is one of the few people in history to bend the rules of business and economics,
earning him a place in financial folklore. And while his methods might not be replicable for
everyone, they do offer an important lesson: sometimes the opportunity isn’t too good to be
true. Konstantin created a tax-free money without going to jail. It’s too bad TikTok wasn’t
around to give it a ton of likes.
