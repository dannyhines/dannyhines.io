Encoding, Encryption and Hashing are all terms that mean “turning data into other data”. But
they’re all different, and when we’re talking about software, small differences can have big
ramifications. So here’s a quick rundown of the difference between the three along with
examples using native Node.js libraries.

<GrayBox>
  **TL;DR**: *Encoding* is when you convert data into a string that can easily be converted
  back, *encryption* is like encoding but the output is random and you need a password to
  convert it back, and *hashing* converts data into the same output every time (a hash), but
  it can’t be converted back.
</GrayBox>

## Encoding

Encoding means converting data into a specialized format so it's easier to deal with. It’s
useful when you want to convert your weird blob of data to a string to put it in a database,
or for reducing the size of the data (i.e. audio and video files).

For audio and video, each file format has a corresponding program called a _codec_ that is
used to encode it into the appropriate format and then decodes it so the data can be read.

Encoding strings can be accomplished with a
[Buffer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_buffers.htm), which is a data
structure that converts the data into a stream of bytes that can easily be converted to
different encodings ("ascii", "utf8", "base64" or "hex”). Here’s an example taking string of
JSON and encoding it with the “base64” encoding type:

```javascript
let data = { person: { name: 'Danny', friends: [] } };
let dataString = JSON.stringify(data);

// Create a Buffer object
let bufferObj = Buffer.from(dataString, 'utf8');

// Encode the Buffer as a base64 string
let base64String = bufferObj.toString('base64');

console.log('Base64 encoded:', base64String);
// Base64 encoded: eyJwZXJzb24iOnsibmFtZSI6IkRhbm55IiwiZnJpZW5kcyI6W119fQ==
```

To encode the string we create a Buffer from it using the `utf8` or Unicode encoding type,
which is basically how a computer encodes the keyboard characters into bytes. Then we use
the `Buffer.toString()` function with the base64 encoding type, which returns the Base64
version of our string.

Then to decode we do the opposite: create a Buffer with the base64-encoded string and decode
it back into Unicode.

```javascript
let newBufferObj = Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64');
let decodedString = newBufferObj.toString('utf8');

console.log('The decoded data:', JSON.parse(decodedString));
// The decoded data: { person: { name: 'Danny', friends: [] } }
```

Encoding is for transmitting or storing data, not keeping it secure. That is - if someone
can tell it’s base64 encoded, then they can easily decode it. Which brings us to the next
topic…

## Encryption

Encryption is the two-way process of turning readable text into unreadable _Ciphertext_,
which can be converted back to the original data using a password or key. This is useful for
sending messages without the risk of third-parties being able to read it.

There are two ways to encrypt data: symmetric and asymmetric encryption. **Symmetric**
encryption uses one key that is shared between all the people who are sending or receiving
encrypted information. **Asymmetric** encryption, or public key encryption, uses two keys:
one for encrypting information and one for decrypting it. The decryption key is kept
private, while the encryption key is shared publicly.

For this example we’re using the built-in [crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)
module and the `Cipher` class to encrypt data.

```javascript
const { scrypt, randomFill, createCipheriv } = require('node:crypto');

const msg = "Here's a super secret message to encrypt";

const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
const password = 'Password used to generate key';

// First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
// In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
  randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

    let encrypted = cipher.update(msg, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    console.log(encrypted);
  });
});
```

Here we’re using the AES encryption algorithm, which is a _symmetric_ encryption algorithm
because it uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting. In this case, the sender and the
receiver will both use the same secret key.

In general, the strength of the encryption is based on how difficult it is to guess the key.
To obscure the results we use an _initialization vector_ (similar to a
[salt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)>)) which is a random chunk of data
that serves as the initial state of the output. The IV gets stored with the output, allowing
the person with the key to decrypt the message while making it harder for a hacker to crack
it.

## Hashing

With a **hashing** algorithm, the data is converted to a unique "digest", “fingerprint” or
“signature”, which is a random string. But unlike with encoding and encryption the output
can’t be converted back to the original.

This algorithm is awesome because while it’s impossible to guess the input, it will always
produce the same result, or hash. This is useful for storing passwords in a database, for
example, because you can ensure that the password they typed is correct without saving the
password itself.

```javascript
const { createHash } = require('node:crypto');

const msg = "Here's a super secret message to hash";

const hash = createHash('sha256').update(msg).digest('hex');

console.log(hash);
// 3e0e072b5af9cf7dd022e507bbcea46ea8e0054311b713e0129937ef60cf3f4c
```

Theoretically, it sounds like it should be possible to figure out the input by trying random
inputs and seeing if it matches the hash you're trying to guess. Assuming the passwords are
random and not "Password123", it would take a little while to guess. The SHA-256 hash is 32
bytes (256 bits) long, so there are a total of 2^256 possible SHA-256 hashes. That is 10^77,
or 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 possible
combinations. If the password could be 25 digits long, it would take expensive computers
billions of years to come up with a valid guess.

Even with all the computers powering the Bitcoin network working together, which
collectively guess around 15 trillion hashes per second, it would take about 650 million
years to guess a valid password. And because multiple passwords can result in the same hash,
the guess would probably be wrong anyway. Changing one character will result in a completely
different hash, which makes it even harder. So yeah, it’s really hard to guess.
