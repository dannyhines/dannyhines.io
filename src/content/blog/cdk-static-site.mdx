## AWS CDK

<MdxRow>
<MdxCol>
AWS's [Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) launched in 2019 as _"a code-first approach to defining cloud application infrastructure"_.
In other words, it's a library of components and a CLI to create and deploy Cloudformation stacks in your language of choice.
It's a lot more powerful than it sounds.<br /><br/>
In AWS fashion, the first iteration was like a pocketknife that was too big to fit in your pocket.
After suffering through mild [npm version hell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66565550/how-to-solve-cdk-cli-version-mismatch),
I was able to build all AWS resources necessary to deploy a website.

### The Architecture

Our website will be _static_, meaning it will contain mostly Javascript files that tell the browser
how to generate the website's HTML and functionality. We'll use React to generate the files, and store them in AWS S3.

In order to get the content to the users, we'll set up a domain through AWS that can listen for HTTP requests.
Instead of directly pointing the user to the datacenter storing the files,
we'll use Cloudfront as our CDN (content delivery network) to cache the content in datacenters all over the world.
To make sure we can connect users securely through HTTPS, we'll also create and attach a certificate for our domain on the Cloudfront distribution.

## Let's make a website, eh?

While at a bar with some friends, someone brought up that there are only about 25 blimps in
the world. Of course I Googled it and was surprised that the entire first page quoted the
same number of 25 blimps.

<Image

  alt='Google search how many blimps'
  width={1760}
  height={1284}
/>

I joked that it would be funny to own howmanyblimpsarethere.com, just to tell people there
are 25. I just learned how to make websites with AWS CDK, so let's see how quickly I could
go from idea to deployed website...

### Create React App

I started by making the React app, which <s>Facebook</s> Meta makes incredibly easy:

```bash
npx create-react-app how-many-blimps
```

<Image
  alt='3 hours later'
  src='/images/cdk-static-site/3-hours-later.png'
  width={678}
  height={457}
/>

Let's do the bare minimum to see how quickly I can make this thing. Removing some defaults
and changing `App.js` to mention the number 25:

<MdxRow>
<MdxCol>
```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h3>
          There are currently <span style={{ fontSize: 64 }}> 25 </span> blimps
          in the world
        </h3>
        <p style={{ fontSize: 18 }}>
          This is probably not accurate. This website is stupid.
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</MdxCol>
<MdxCol>
  **The Site:**

alt='How Many Blimps website'
width={2102}
height={1472}
/>
</MdxCol>
</MdxRow>

Nailed it.

### Create a CDK project

Next we'll make the CDK app within this repository. The infrastructure will live in the
`infra` folder.

```bash
cd how-many-blimps
mkdir infra
cd infra
```

If you don't have the CDK CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

If you haven't done so already, login and set your AWS credentials with `aws configure`.

Then use the CLI to initialize a new project in the empty `infra` folder:

```bash
cdk init app --language=typescript
```

## AWS Resources (as code)

The only prerequisite is buying a domain from Route53 (around $12 for most domains). Also
important to note: the associated S3 bucket name (i.e. 'google.com') can't be taken.

The CDK creates creates a bunch of files by default, but you'll probably only need to edit
the code within `bin` and `lib`. Inside the `bin` directory you have the executable(s) that
run during commands with the CDK CLI tool.

The `bin/infra.ts` file should look something like this:

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
import 'source-map-support/register';
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { WebsiteStack } from '../lib/blimps-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new WebsiteStack(app, 'BlimpsStack', {
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION },
});
```

This Stack only uses the default `env` parameter for the stack, which is the AWS account and
region you're deploying your resources to. That's all we need to the executable, let's move
on to the actual CDK components.

### The Stack

Inside the `lib/` folder we include the stacks, which are created using Components from the
npm library.

Here's our stack for the website infrastructure:

```ts
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as route53 from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53';
import * as acm from '@aws-cdk/aws-certificatemanager';
import * as s3 from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3';
import * as s3deploy from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment';
import * as cloudFront from '@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront';
import * as targets from '@aws-cdk/aws-route53-targets/lib';

const DOMAIN_NAME = 'howmanyblimpsarethere.com';

export class WebsiteStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    let domainName = DOMAIN_NAME;

    // Hosted Zone
    const zone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'Zone', {
      domainName: domainName,
    });

    // Add S3 Bucket
    const s3Site = new s3.Bucket(this, `blimps-web-bucket`, {
      bucketName: domainName,
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
      websiteErrorDocument: 'index.html',
    });

    // Create second S3 bucket for www.domain.com
    const wwwBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, `blimps-web-www-bucket`, {
      bucketName: 'www.' + domainName,
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: undefined,
      websiteRedirect: {
        hostName: domainName,
        protocol: s3.RedirectProtocol.HTTPS,
      },
    });

    // TLS certificates
    const certificateArn = new acm.DnsValidatedCertificate(this, 'SiteCertificate', {
      domainName,
      hostedZone: zone,
      subjectAlternativeNames: [domainName, 'www.' + domainName],
      region: 'us-east-1', // Cloudfront only checks this region for certificates.
    }).certificateArn;

    // Create a new CloudFront Distribution
    const distribution = new cloudFront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(
      this,
      'blimps-cf-distribution',
      {
        aliasConfiguration: {
          acmCertRef: certificateArn,
          names: [domainName, 'www.' + domainName],
          sslMethod: cloudFront.SSLMethod.SNI,
          securityPolicy: cloudFront.SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_1_2016,
        },
        viewerProtocolPolicy: cloudFront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS,
      }
    );

    // Route53 alias record for the CloudFront distribution
    new route53.ARecord(this, 'SiteAliasRecord', {
      recordName: domainName,
      target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(new targets.CloudFrontTarget(distribution)),
      zone,
    });
    new route53.ARecord(this, 'wwwAliasRecord', {
      recordName: 'www.' + domainName,
      target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(new targets.CloudFrontTarget(distribution)),
      zone,
    });

    // Setup Bucket Deployment to automatically deploy new assets and invalidate cache
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, `blimps-s3bucketdeployment`, {
  sources: [s3deploy.Source.asset('../build')],
  destinationBucket: s3Site,
  distribution: distribution,
  distributionPaths: ['/*'],
});

// for the www bucket
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, `blimps-www-s3bucketdeployment`, {
  sources: [],
  destinationBucket: wwwBucket,
  distribution: distribution,
});
  }
```

#### Let's break it down.

We start by making the hosted zone, which takes in our domain from Route53) as a parameter.
Then we make the S3 bucket(s) for howmanyblimpsarethere.com and
www.howmanyblimpsarethere.com.

```ts
const zone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'Zone', {
  domainName: domainName,
});

const s3Site = new s3.Bucket(this, 'blimps-web-bucket', {
  bucketName: domainName,
  publicReadAccess: true,
  websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
  websiteErrorDocument: 'index.html',
});

// Create second S3 bucket for www.domain.com
const wwwBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'blimps-web-www-bucket', {
  bucketName: 'www.' + domainName,
  publicReadAccess: true,
  websiteIndexDocument: undefined,
  websiteRedirect: {
    hostName: domainName,
    protocol: s3.RedirectProtocol.HTTPS,
  },
});
```

We also need a TLS certificate for the url, and we want to make sure we include the `www.`
subdomain.

```ts
const certificateArn = new acm.DnsValidatedCertificate(this, 'SiteCertificate', {
  domainName,
  hostedZone: zone,
  subjectAlternativeNames: [domainName, 'www.' + domainName],
  region: 'us-east-1',
}).certificateArn;
```

Then we create a Cloudfront distribution and attach the certificate we made in the previous
step (so we can use SSL). Then we can create a Route53 alias record within the Hosted Zone
we made, that points to the distribution:

```ts
const distribution = new cloudFront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(
  this,
  'blimps-cf-distribution',
  {
    aliasConfiguration: {
      acmCertRef: certificateArn,
      names: [domainName, 'www.' + domainName],
      sslMethod: cloudFront.SSLMethod.SNI,
      securityPolicy: cloudFront.SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_1_2016,
    },
    viewerProtocolPolicy: cloudFront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS,
  }
);
```

(If you want to see how to include CORS settings, click
[here](https://github.com/danielchines/how-many-blimps/blob/main/infra/lib/blimps-stack.ts#L67)).

And finally we need to take take whatever is in the build folder, put it in the S3 bucket
and invalidate the CDN (Cloudfront) so the content will refresh immediately:

```ts
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, `blimps-s3bucketdeployment`, {
  sources: [s3deploy.Source.asset('../build')],
  destinationBucket: s3Site,
  distribution: distribution,
  distributionPaths: ['/*'],
});

// for the www bucket
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, `blimps-www-s3bucketdeployment`, {
  sources: [],
  destinationBucket: wwwBucket,
  distribution: distribution,
});
```

If any of the above resources haven't been created, the CLI will create a diff of what's
currently deployed in AWS vs. what's in the new stack, and either (a) deploy new resources,
(b) update them, or (c) do nothing if there's nothing to change.

So let's go back to the React app and build it:

```bash
cd ..
npm run build
```

That'll compile the Typescript and put everything in the /build folder, which we specify in
the `s3deploy.BucketDeployment` component. Now all you need to do is run the CLI command to
deploy it:

```bash
cd infra
aws configure // if you credentials aren't set
cdk deploy
```

And that's it! I bought the domain during the Pregame of a Sunday night NFL game, and by
halftime it was deployed. Copy-paste these components and you could do it even faster.
Pretty frickin sweet.
