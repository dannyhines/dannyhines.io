On a [previous blog post](https://www.dannyhines.io/blog/the-nikkei) I wrote about the ‚Äúlong
run‚Äù in investing, pointing out that Japan's stock market _still_ hasn't recovered from the
asset pricing bubble in the late 1980s. Just as Japanese markets are appearing to turn
around, the Bank of Japan recently elected a new governor.

This time we're looking at Japan's Yield Curve Control policy and how unbelievably different
the US and Japanese central banks are viewing the economic landscape.

### The State of Play

Back in September, I believed that the pending recession was just months away. 8 months
later, and we‚Äôre still just months away from a recession.

Sure, the market dipped in 2022, but it didn‚Äôt get the message that we‚Äôre supposed to be in
a recession. We're up ~7% in 2023, inflation is subsiding and unemployment is still at an
all-time low.

Despite the high-profile layoffs, bank failures, and a war in Ukraine, people keep buying
stuff.

Last week, the Fed announced another 25 bp rate hike, bringing the Fed Funds rate to 5.25%.
This is the fastest the Fed has raised interest rates since the cigar-chomping Paul Volcker
took over as Chairman in August 1979. We think 5% rates are bad; Volcker raised rates from
11 to 20% in nine months. The U.S. went into a brutal recession and he didn‚Äôt give a fuck
because inflation was out of control.

Since WWII that‚Äôs been the formula: the economy gets hot, inflation gets too high, then the
Fed raises interest rates to cool it back down. People lose jobs, companies innovate less,
but that‚Äôs a lot better than everyone losing 10% of their savings every year. Then a few
years later we‚Äôre back to champagne and cocaine until we‚Äôre all sweating and don‚Äôt even
realize it.

<GrayBox>
  üí° When the Fed Funds rate goes up, inflation should come down. Because as the Fed charges
  banks more, it becomes more expensive for everyone to borrow. That makes people less
  likely to spend and invest, and <i>should</i> force businesses to lower prices. It would
  also help if the Fed stopped printing trillions of dollars, but that‚Äôs a different talk
  show.
</GrayBox>

Current chairman Jerome Powell has been clear: inflation hurts everyone, so he‚Äôll do what‚Äôs
necessary to stop it. Does anyone else smell smoke?

So far he‚Äôs cranked up interest rates to a steamy 5.25% to fight off the dragon of that is
inflation. Europe is battling a 10% chimera of its own. But Japan? Their inflation is
sitting at a cool 1.6%, and they‚Äôre nervously sipping tea while the world burns.

## Why the cold feet, Japan?

In a world where growth is still blazing hot, Japan seems to be thawing from an economic ice
age.

Sure a 6% inflation rate is bad, but Japan‚Äôs frosty 1.6% inflation rate isn‚Äôt necessarily a
good thing. Conventional wisdom says that a 2% inflation rate is generally healthy to
encourage consumers to move money around, which is basically the definition of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù
economy.

Japan hasn‚Äôt had an inflation problem the asset pricing bubble in the late 1980s. Since
then, the economy has performed worse than the Cleveland Browns.

## The Yield Curve Control Policy

Japan's monetary policy, known as Yield Curve Control (YCC), has been in place since 2016.

Under the YCC policy, the BoJ sets a target level for the yield on 10-year government bonds
at 0%, or even negative. The BoJ achieves this by purchasing their own bonds in the
secondary market to maintain the target level. If the yield gets too high, it'll buy more.
If the yield begins to fall below the target level, they sell them to push the yield up.

In my cases, the Japanese interest rates have been negative, essentially letting banks
borrow for free, or even charging them if they don‚Äôt spend it. _And they‚Äôre still not
spending it!_

This is to stimulate economic growth, or face a more familiar enemy of Japan: deflation.
This chart looks bizarre, especially when contrasted with the U.S.

Adding to the drama is that the BOJ just appointed a new governor Kazuo Ueda, who has a
seemingly impossible task of thawing the Japanese stock market.

In his first meeting, he decided to maintain their negative interest rate, hoping the
economy will heat up over time.

<GrayBox>
  "While trend inflation is gradually heightening, it will take some time to achieve our
  inflation target.‚Äù [...] The risk of missing our price target with premature monetary
  tightening is bigger than the risk of experiencing inflation exceeding 2% due to a delayed
  tightening. The cost of waiting for trend inflation to heighten is low," he said.

## The Rising Tsunami

As America sweats under the heat of high interest rates and rampant inflation, the thought
of Japan stoking its own economic furnace might seem like a welcome thought. But don't trade
your fire extinguisher for a snow shovel just yet. The Land of the Rising Sun's reversal in
the YCC policy could trigger a tsunami that could wash over global markets.

Why the concern, you might ask? Isn't that the central banking equivalent of your neighbor
melting their driveway? Not exactly, because Japan's stock market is no small iceberg. It's
more like an entire arctic shelf, and it's been frozen for a long ass time.

Consider this: the Bank of Japan raises interest rates. Suddenly, those icy cold bonds start
looking like a beer in a frozen glass. Investors, drawn by the promise of better returns,
rush in. The yen strengthens, and the floodgates open.

Just recently Warren Buffet upped
[his stake](https://apnews.com/article/buffett-berkshire-hathaway-japanese-trading-houses-investments-8ec8de0717ca80845e1db354528a441e)
in Japanese five trading houses.

Now, here's where the tsunami warning comes in. Japan's economy is so massive, and its stock
market so integral to the global financial ecosystem, that a sudden shift could send
shockwaves through global markets. The once too-hot-to-handle U.S. market could finally see
the recession everyone has been talking about.

  üí° A stronger yen means that Japanese goods become more expensive for foreign buyers,
  which could lead to a decrease in exports. At the same time, foreign goods become cheaper
  for Japanese consumers, potentially leading to an increase in imports. Both of these
  factors could further heat up Japan's economy.

Picture the U.S., Europe, and other economies - already trying to douse their inflation
infernos - now having to contend with a wave of capital outflow. The result would be a
soggy, steamy mess that could leave us all wishing for a return to the good old days of
simply sweating over interest rates.

So, as we continue to monitor the temperature of global economies, keep one eye on the
thermostat and the other on the horizon. Because some day the ice will melt in Japan, and
the resulting wave could reach all the way to our shores. Until then, stay tuned for the
next thrilling chapter in the ongoing saga of the world's central banks.
