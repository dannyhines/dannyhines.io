On a [previous blog post](https://www.dannyhines.io/blog/the-nikkei) I wrote about the ‚Äúlong
run‚Äù in investing, pointing out that Japan's stock market _still_ hasn't recovered from the
asset pricing bubble in the late 1980s. Meanwhile the United States has been on an epic bull
run, only to be stopped by the Federal Reserve raising rates.

What I didn't mention is how Japan has tried to heat up their economy: since 2016 they've
implemented the **Yield Curve Control** policy, which sets interest rates at or below zero.
Finally, it appears the ice is starting to melt on Japan's economic ice age.

The Bank of Japan just elected a new governor, Kazuo Ueda, who has the opportunity to end
that policy and trigger a heat wave that would send ripples through global markets.

### The State of Play

Back in September, I believed that the pending recession was just months away. 8 months
later, and we‚Äôre still just months away from a recession.

Sure the market dipped in 2022, but it didn‚Äôt get the message that we‚Äôre supposed to be in a
recession. The S&P is up ~8% in 2023, inflation is subsiding and unemployment is still at an
all-time low.

Despite the high-profile layoffs, bank failures, and a war in Ukraine, people keep buying
stuff.

Last week the Fed announced another 25 bp rate hike, bringing the Fed Funds rate to 5.25%.
This is the fastest the Fed has raised interest rates since the cigar-chomping Paul Volcker
took over as Chairman in August 1979 and raised rates from 11 to 20% in nine months. The
U.S. went into a brutal recession and he didn‚Äôt give a fuck because inflation was out of
control.

Since WWII that‚Äôs been the formula: the economy gets hot, inflation gets too high, then the
Fed raises interest rates to cool it back down. People lose jobs, companies innovate less,
but that‚Äôs a lot better than everyone losing 10% of their savings every year. Then a few
years later we‚Äôre back to champagne and cocaine until we‚Äôre all sweating and don‚Äôt even
realize it.

<GrayBox>
  üí° When the Fed Funds rate goes up, inflation should come down. Because as the Fed charges
  banks more, it becomes more expensive for everyone to borrow. That makes people less
  likely to spend and invest, and makes it tougher for businesses to finance new projects.
  It would also help if the Fed stopped printing trillions of dollars, but that‚Äôs a
  different talk show.
</GrayBox>

Current chairman Jerome Powell has been clear: inflation hurts everyone, so he‚Äôll do what‚Äôs
necessary to stop it. Does anyone else smell smoke?

So far he‚Äôs cranked up interest rates to a steamy 5.25% to fight off the dragon of that is
inflation. Europe is battling a 10% chimera of its own. But Japan? Their inflation is
sitting at a cool 1.6%, and they‚Äôre nervously sipping tea while the world burns.

## Why the cold feet, Japan?

In a world where growth is still blazing hot, Japan seems to be thawing from an economic ice
age.

Sure a 6% inflation rate is bad, but Japan‚Äôs frosty 1.6% inflation rate isn‚Äôt necessarily a
good thing. Conventional wisdom says that a 2% inflation rate is generally healthy to
encourage consumers to move money around, which is basically the definition of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù
economy.

Japan hasn‚Äôt had an inflation problem the asset pricing bubble in the late 1980s. Since
then, the economy has performed worse than the Cleveland Browns.

## The Yield Curve Control Policy

Japan's monetary policy, known as Yield Curve Control (YCC), has been in place since 2016.

Under the YCC policy, the BoJ sets a target level for the yield on 10-year government bonds
at 0%. The BoJ achieves this by purchasing their own bonds in the secondary market to
maintain the target level. If the yield gets too high, it'll buy more. If the yield begins
to fall below the target level, they sell them to push the yield up.

By committing to keep 10-year bond yields at 0%, even if inflation rises, the BOJ signals
that it will continue to keep borrowing costs low in the future, which should,
theoretically, raise expectations of future inflation and thereby stimulate spending today.

Also part of this policy is that the short-term interest rate is set at -0.1%, essentially
letting banks borrow for free and charging them if they don‚Äôt spend it. _And they‚Äôre still
not spending it!_

This is to stimulate economic growth, or face a more familiar enemy of Japan: deflation.
This chart looks bizarre, especially when contrasted with the U.S.

Adding to the drama is that the BOJ just appointed a new governor Kazuo Ueda, who has a
seemingly impossible task of thawing the Japanese stock market.

After the central bank's first meeting he decided to maintain the YCC policy, hoping the
economy continue to heat up over time. In typical government fashion, the 71-year-old
governor said they'd do a review of his predecessor's monetary policy and circle back in a
year or two.

  "While trend inflation is gradually heightening, it will take some time to achieve our
  inflation target.‚Äù [...] The risk of missing our price target with premature monetary
  tightening is bigger than the risk of experiencing inflation exceeding 2% due to a delayed
  tightening. The cost of waiting for trend inflation to heighten is low," he said.

## The Rising Tsunami

As America sweats under the heat of high interest rates and rampant inflation, the thought
of Japan stoking its own economic furnace might seem like a welcome thought. But don't trade
your fire extinguisher for a snow shovel just yet. The Land of the Rising Sun's reversal in
the YCC policy could trigger a tsunami that could wash over global markets.

Why the concern, you might ask? Isn't that the central banking equivalent of your neighbor
melting their driveway? Not exactly, because Japan's stock market is no small iceberg. It's
more like an entire arctic shelf, and it's been frozen for a long ass time.

Consider this: the Bank of Japan raises interest rates. Suddenly, those Japanese bonds start
looking like a beer in a frozen glass. Investors, drawn by the promise of better returns,
rush in. The yen strengthens, and the floodgates open.

Just recently Warren Buffet upped
[his stake](https://apnews.com/article/buffett-berkshire-hathaway-japanese-trading-houses-investments-8ec8de0717ca80845e1db354528a441e)
in Japanese five trading houses.

Here's where the tsunami warning comes in. Japan's economy is so massive, and its stock
market so integral to the global financial ecosystem, that a sudden shift could send
shockwaves through global markets.

  üí° A stronger yen means that Japanese goods become more expensive for foreign buyers,
  which could lead to a decrease in exports. At the same time, foreign goods become cheaper
  for Japanese consumers, potentially leading to an increase in imports.
</GrayBox>

That would mean the Fed, already trying to douse our inflation inferno, would also have to
contend with a wave of capital outflow. The result would be a soggy, steamy mess - and
perhaps the recession everyone has been talking about.

So, as we continue to monitor the temperature of global economies, keep one eye on Japan.
Because some day the ice will melt, and the resulting wave could reach all the way to our
shores. Until then, stay tuned for the next thrilling chapter in the ongoing saga of the
world's central banks.
