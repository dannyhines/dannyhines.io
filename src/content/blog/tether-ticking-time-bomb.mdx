## Preface

The recent collapse of FTX (and the market as a whole) has reminded me of a topic that has
been on mind my for the past several years. I don’t own any crypto, although I consume
plenty of crypto content and think Bitcoin is awesome. I think that gives me a unique
perspective to discuss the $70 billion elephant in the room.

At the time FTX froze customer withdrawals, they claimed to have about $14 billion on their
balance sheet, most of which was the value of its own token $FTT. Sam Bankman-Fried, the
owner of FTX, loaned money to his failing hedge fund (run by a
[28-year-old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW6SqLXw944) with less than two years of
trading experience), in order to save the sinking ship. The problem was that they loaned
their customers’ money, and after the price of FTT lost even more value, their assets were
worth about
[$8 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/sam-bankman-fried-s-ftx-faces-8-billion-shortfall-possible-bankruptcy)
less than what customers had deposited. Because lending has become a foundation of the
crypto industry, this caused a chain reaction of margin calls and forced selling, bringing
the entire market down. The shock crushed asset prices even outside of crypto, wiping out
nearly $150 billion over two days (and counting).

What if I told you that there was an even sketchier company that shared ownership with an
even sketchier crypto exchange, that was over five times larger than Alameda Research and
FTX? That’s [Tether](https://tether.to/): the single most critical institution in the
cryptocurrency industry and a financial bomb waiting to go off.

## What is Tether

Tether, also known by its U.S. currency code **USDT**, is an asset-backed cryptocurrency
stablecoin. The idea is simple: it’s a cryptocurrency that will always be worth $1.

<MdxRow className='my-0'>
  <MdxCol>
    This simplifies the process of trading dollars for cryptocurrencies, and is a safe way 
    for people in underdeveloped economies to own and exchange the world’s reserve currency.

    The value of USDT is “pegged” at $1 because for every 1 USDT that Tether issues,
    supposedly they take dollar you paid and put it in a bank account, ready to be redeemed
    for 1 USDT. I say _supposedly_ because over the past ~7 years they’ve consistently
    avoided transparency and outright lied, while growing their market cap and becoming the
    largest unregulated holder of U.S. dollars ever.

## Tether’s sketchy history

Tether has been sketchy since it was first released on Bitfinex in 2015.

Bitfinex, one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges, launched in 2012. The company has moved
between a series of banks, never disclosing to customers where the money is kept. The same
is true for Tether, which was created two years later.

Representatives from both Bitfinex and Tether claimed that the two companies were separate.
We now know from the
[Paradise Papers](https://news.bitcoin.com/paradise-papers-reveal-bitfinexs-devasini-and-potter-established-tether-already-back-in-2014/)
that Tether was established in the British Virgin Islands in
[2014](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464) by Philip Potter and Giancarlo
Devasini. Potter was Bitfinex’s chief strategy officer, Devasini was Bitfinex’s CEO. Mr.
Potter served as the first director of Tether alongside Jean-Louis Van Der Velde, who is
also the CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether. So yeah, no conflict of interest.

Chief strategy officer Philip Potter seems to be the most public-facing of the founders. He
worked for Morgan Stanley in the 90s but was fired after he was featured in a (surprisingly
satirical)
[NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/business/faces-of-the-new-york-economy-big-earner-big-spender-little-burden.html)
about how expensive his lifestyle was. Mr. Devasini, a former plastic surgeon, has a track
record of
[screwing clients](https://www.ft.com/content/4da3060c-8e1a-439f-a1d7-a6a4688ad6ca) in the
hardware industry and was fined 100 million Italian lira for selling pirated copies of
Microsoft software. The CEO of Bitfinex and Tether, Ludovicus Jan Van Der Velde (or
[also](https://twitter.com/jacobcanfield/status/1122879425329160192?lang=en) Jean-Louis van
der Velde?), barely even exists. There’s almost nothing about him online, and only one or
two pictures.

It’s difficult to find information about the location and employees at either company; their
banks and servers seem to move every couple years from Hong Kong to the British Virgin
Islands, to Taiwan, to Switzerland. It’s like the company’s mission is to survive, built
with an eject button to disappear when shit hits the fan.

## Market Manipulation

In 2020, researchers John Griffin and Amin Shams wrote a
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12903) describing the flow of money
between Tether and crypto exchanges, alleging that Tether used its reserves to artificially
inflation crypto prices during the 2017 boom.

> Using algorithms to analyze blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed
> following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. The flow is
> attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric
> autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufficient Tether reserves before month-ends.
> Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most consistent with the
> supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency prices.

For a primary source, check out this Reddit
[post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6719bj/tether_announcement_about_their_banking_problems/)
in April 2017, where a user questioned the legitimacy of Tether and their relationship to
Bitfinex, as the price of Bitcoin exploded while USDT lost its peg to the US dollar:

> Some time ago, certain bitcoin exchanges (particularly Bitfinex and Poloniex) have started
> quoting their Cryptocurrencies in a unit known as "USDT" or Tether. Apparently Bitfinex
> has an ownership interest in this "tether" and back in late december the market cap of

> being made clear, which I think is having an unhealthy influence on price rallies in
> cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, I have doubts that this tether is backed by dollars at all
> and in all likelihood is a fractional reserve.

In the 9 months that followed, questions about Tether and their reserves never stopped,
while the market cap of USDT grew 4000%.

## Security

Tether had a tough time dealing with withdrawals in 2017, which was most likely due to Wells
Fargo cutting off U.S. wire transfers for Bitfinex.

Bitfinex has been hacked several times. A hacker stole 1,500 Bitcoin in 2015 and in August
of 2016 someone stole 120,000 Bitcoin, which was worth around $75 million at the time or
over $2 billion today.

The company spread out the losses to all customers by essentially removing 36% from
everyone’s wallet, even those who were not holding Bitcoin.

Tether has also been hacked; they [lost](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42065724) $31
million in 2017. To combat the lost money, they suspended trading and created a “hard fork”,
which meant anyone who integrated with Tether had to
[update their software](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21) to make sure
that the stolen funds couldn’t be redeemed.

## Is it really 1-to-1?

For the first couple years, Tether never released any information on its reserves and
claimed they were routinely audited, although they never released information on the audits.
And in 2018, they were transparent in announcing they had
[fired their auditor](https://web.archive.org/web/20220201145039/https://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-tether-splits-with-its-auditors-friedman-llp-2018-1).

As questions raised about Tether, the company realized it was too large to avoid attention.
They published a
[memorandum](https://web.archive.org/web/20171212144732/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf)
from a third-party accounting firm, which was a 6-page document filled with lawyer jargon
alongside tables where user deposits = amount in bank accounts, without disclosing any
details. Eventually, government agencies had enough.

### The CFTC

In December of 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a
[subpoena](https://web.archive.org/web/20180201014313/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc)
to Tether and Bitfinex concerning the backing of USDT. After all, before February 25th 2019,
Tether’s website claimed that “_Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional
currency held in our reserves. So 1 USDT is always equivalent to 1 USD”._

After February 25, 2019, Tether updated their terms and conditions to say "_Tether Tokens
are 100% backed by Tether’s Reserves”._ They define reserves as “_traditional currency and
cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans
made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities”_.

On October 15, 2021, Tether Limited paid a fine of $41.6 million to the
[CFTC](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21) for their original claim that
USDT were 100% backed by dollars.

### The New York Attorney General

In the Spring of 2019, the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) launched an inquiry
into Bitfinex and Tether. They alleged that Bitfinex lost almost a billion dollars in
customer funds, mostly through a sketchy crypto payment processor called
[Crypto Capital Corp](https://protos.com/crypto-capital-corp-reginald-fowler-yosef-shadow-bank-history/).
Then in order to cover it up, they asked Tether - which shares ownership and executives with
Bitfinex - to loan them $550 million of their own customers’ money.

<GrayBox>
  💡 In hindsight this is exactly what regulation and oversight is for, because it’s
  precisely what caused the recent collapse of FTX. FTX loaned customer deposits to a hedge
  fund Alameda Research, which similarly shared ownership with FTX, and when they couldn’t
  pay it back it collapsed the entire market.
</GrayBox>

This meant that Tether did not always have a 1-to-1 backing of dollars, which is concerning
given the giant market cap of USDT. They also took fault with a
[blog post](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/356) Bitfinex wrote after the NYAG’s inquiry
announcement, where they claimed the money had been “seized and safeguarded”. In reality,
the money was confiscated from Portuguese, American and British officials who are still in
legal battles about what to do with it.

From New York Attorney General Letitia James:

> "Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep
> their scheme going and protect their bottom lines. Tether’s claims that its virtual
> currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.”

The inquiry lasted 22 months and during that time, USDT’s market cap grew from $2 billion to
over $34 billion.

## Transparency

To respond to the NYAG’s inquiry, Bitfinex
[announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205160916/https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/600)
that they paid back the $550 from Tether, and Tether released a detailed look into their
reserves for the first time.

According to the disclosure, roughly 76% of their reserves are made up cash and cash
equivalents. The majority of that is in commercial paper, which is short-term debt which is
treated similar to cash. This would make Tether one of the
[largest](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a) holders of
commercial paper in the world, with the likes of Vanguard and dwarfing the investments of
Google and Apple. About 10% of Tether’s money is in corporate bonds, funds and precious
metals. 12% is in secured loans, none of which are to “affiliated entities”, which we can
take to mean crypto exchanges. They claim only 1.64% is in digital tokens.

You gotta trust a pie chart that uses the default Excel color scheme. These numbers could be
completely legitimate, I have no idea. The point is that the entire crypto industry hinges
on their validity, which is a lot to ask of a company that doesn’t tell you _where_ the
assets are stored.

A few days later, Bitfinex’s general counsel Stuart Hoegner wrote a
[blog post](https://stuarthoegner.medium.com/tether-is-setting-a-new-standard-for-transparency-and-responding-to-criticism-that-is-fc130e08319b)
explaining Tether’s legal and financial position.

Whenever a company gets caught breaking the law they typically pay millions in fines and use
the phrase “admitted no wrongdoing”. No matter if a company
[exposed customer information](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-reaches-500m-settlement-cyberattack-suit),
a CEO
[misled investors](https://www.pymnts.com/legal/2022/sec-alumni-ventures-group-misled-investors/)
or the government
[caused deaths](https://www.nj.com/politics/2022/08/state-to-pay-out-nearly-16m-to-families-over-covid-deaths-in-nj-veterans-homes-admits-no-wrongdoing.html) -
they never admit wrongdoing. If fact, that’s probably why they pay millions of dollars.
Paying the NYAG is much better than admitting to fraud, and opening themselves up to
lawsuits from millions of customers.

In that post Hoegner also vowed the company would release periodic
[assurance opinions](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) conducted by an independent
accounting firm to assure their customers . That firm is
[Moore Cayman](https://www.moore.ky/), which if you click on that link (the one that Hoegner
provided in his blog post), the website is for a UK company’s Cayman Islands office and
makes no mention of the name “Moore Cayman”, but that’s par for the course with Tether.
Either way, when I think of regulation and transparency, of course the first country that
comes to mind is the Cayman Islands.

And in the name of transparency, I should point out that periodic reporting of their
reserves was a part of the
[settlement](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf).
Along with a $18.5 million fine for damages to the state of New York, the AG mandated
Bitfinex and Tether to report their current reserve status and budget and any transactions
between the two companies, as well as provide public reports (the “Transparency” tab on
their website) for the composition of their cash and non-cash reserves every quarter for the
next two years.

Ironically, if the NYAG’s lawsuit forced Tether to take its money out of risky assets, it
did so at the market top. Assuming these numbers are accurate, if Tether had been using
customer funds to buy Bitcoin around 2017 and sold it to buy treasury bills during the
inquiry, they would’ve been up around 700%. They put together the breakdown of their
reserves in the winter of 2021, released it in the Spring, and the market has cratered ever
since.

## Conclusion

When the LUNA token and its associated stablecoin UST collapsed in May, it caused almost
every token’s price to fall 30% and sent several companies out of business (3AC, Voyager,
BlockFi, and eventually Celsius). At the peak, Terra (UST) had an $18.75B market cap and
averaged $120M in volume. Tether has ~ $70B in market cap and averages ~$90B in volume per
day.

If Tether doesn’t have the reserves that they claim, we are doing the biggest stress test in
financial history to determine if that’s true.

Most American users trust Coinbase because it’s a publicly-traded US stock, but that doesn’t
mean it can’t go bankrupt. The shady companies that don’t disclose where they’re located our
who even runs the company? Those collapse all the time. Sadly for the entire history of
crypto, losing millions of dollars in customers’ deposits is
[par for the course](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/).

Crypto enthusiasts can mostly be split into two groups: (1) the Bitcoin fanatics who believe
decentralization is the most important aspect of cryptocurrencies, and (2) those who want to
see the value of their coins go up. Most people fall into the latter group.

I hope Tether doesn’t collapse. But if it does, the entire market will collapse, and we’ll
be hearing a lot more about decentralization.
